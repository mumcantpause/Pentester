# Web App Security Testing vs Web App Pentesting:
"Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the web application without actively exploiting them" VS "Actively attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess the organization's response to attacks".


# Common Web Application:
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to unauthorized access to user data, session hijacking, and browser manipulation.

2. SQL Injection (SQLi):
Attackers manipulate user input to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database, leading to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or database compromise.

3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
Attackers trick authenticated users into unknowingly performing actions on a web application, such as changing account details, by exploiting their active sessions.

4. Security Misconfigurations:
Improperly configured servers, databases, or application frameworks can expose sensitive data or provide entry points for attackers.

5. Sensitive Data Exposure:
Failure to adequately protect sensitive data, such as passwords or personal information, can lead to data breaches and identity theft.

6. Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing Attacks Attackers:
Use automated tools to guess usernames and passwords, attempting to gain unauthorized access
to user accounts.

7. File Upload Vulnerabilities:
Insecure file upload mechanisms can enable attackers to upload malicious files, leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access to the server.

8. Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denialof-Service (DDoS):
DoS and DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm web application servers, causing service disruptions and denying legitimate users access.

9. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
Attackers use SSRF to make requests from the server to internal resources or external networks, potentially leading to data theft or unauthorized access.

10. Inadequate Access Controls:
Weak access controls may allow unauthorized users to access restricted functionalities or sensitive data.

11. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:
Integrating third-party components with known security flaws can introduce weaknesses into the web application.

12. Broken Access Control:
Inadequate access controls can allow unauthorized users to access restricted functionalities or sensitive data.


## Web Server:
Responsible receiving http request

## Application Server:
Processing user request and generate dynamic content to web server

## Headers (Request/Response):
Http Method, Host, User-Agent, Authorization, Cookie, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Connection

Http Status Code, Date, Cache-Control, Content-Type, Content-Encoding, Content-Length, Set-Cookie,   


## Web App Pentesting Methodologies
1. Pre–Engagement:
● Define the scope and objectives of the penetration test, including the target web application, URLs, and functionalities to be tested.
● Obtain proper authorization and permission from the application owner to conduct the test.
● Gather relevant information about the application, such as technologies used, user roles, and business-critical functionalities.

2. Information Gathering & Reconnaissance:
● Perform passive reconnaissance to gather publicly available information about the application and its infrastructure.
● Enumerate subdomains, directories, and files to discover hidden or sensitive content.
● Use tools like "Nmap" to identify open ports and services running on the web server.
● Utilize "Google Dorks" to find indexed information, files, and directories on the target website.

3. Threat Modeling:
● Analyze the application's architecture and data flow to identify potential threats and attack vectors.
● Build an attack surface model to understand how attackers can interact with the application.
● Identify potential high-risk areas and prioritize testing efforts accordingly.

4. Vulnerability Scanning:
● Use automated web vulnerability scanners like "Burp Suite" or "OWASP ZAP" to identify common security flaws.
● Verify and validate the scan results manually to eliminate false positives and false negatives.

5. Manual Testing & Exploitation:
● Perform manual testing to validate and exploit identified vulnerabilities in the application.
● Test for input validation issues, authentication bypass, authorization flaws, and business logic vulnerabilities.
● Attempt to exploit security flaws to demonstrate their impact and potential risk to the application.

6. Authentication & Authorization Testing:
● Test the application's authentication mechanisms to identify weaknesses in password policies, session management, and account lockout procedures.
● Evaluate the application's access controls to ensure that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive functionalities or data.

7. Session Management Testing:
● Evaluate the application's session management mechanisms to prevent session fixation, session hijacking, and session-related attacks.
● Check for session timeout settings and proper session token handling.

8. Information Disclosure:
● Review how the application handles sensitive information such as passwords, user data, and confidential files.
● Test for information disclosure through error messages, server responses, or improper access controls.

9. Business Logic Testing:
● Analyze the application's business logic to identify flaws that could lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
● Test for order-related vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, and other business logic flaws.

10. Client-Side Testing:
● Evaluate the client-side code (HTML, JavaScript) for potential security vulnerabilities, such as DOMbased XSS.
● Test for insecure client-side storage and sensitive data exposure.

11. Reporting & Remediation 
● Document and prioritize the identified security vulnerabilities and risks.
● Provide a detailed report to developers and stakeholders, including recommendations for remediation.
● Assist developers in fixing the identified security issues and retesting the application to ensure that the fixes were successful.

12. Post-Engagement 
● Conduct a post-engagement meeting to discuss the test results with stakeholders.
● Provide security awareness training to the development team to promote secure coding practices.



## Penetration Testing Execution Standard - PTES:
PTES is a complete penetration testing methodology that covers all aspects of security assessments, including web application testing.
