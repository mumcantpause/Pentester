### Topic OverView:
+ Introduction To Web Services
+ Web Service Implementations
+ WSDL Language Fundamentals
+ Web Service Security Testing
+ SOAP Web Service Security Testing



### Learning Objectives:
+ You will have a solid understanding of what web services are, how they work and how they differ from traditional APIs and web applications.
+ You will have an understanding of the different types of Web Service implementations (XML-RPC, SOAP, REST etc) and how they work.
+ You will have an understanding of the WSDL language and how it is used to describe the functionality of web services.
+ You will have an understanding of how to methodologically test a SOAP based web service for common vulnerabilities.
+ You will be able to find and identify WSDL files to discover methods and operations pertinent to the web service.
+ You will be able to invoke hidden methods and test web services for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and command injection.

### Web Services


## Web Services vs Web Applications:

# Web Services:
● Web services are designed to facilitate communication and data
exchange between different software systems over the internet.

● They provide a standardized way for different applications to interact with each other, often using protocols like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) or REST (Representational State Transfer).

● Web services are typically used for machine-to-machine communication and are not meant for direct human interaction.

● No user interface, Exchange structured, Protocols like SOAP, REST, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC.




# Web Applications:
● Web applications are software programs that are accessed through a web browser and are designed to perform specific tasks or provide services directly to end-users.

● They are meant for human interaction and can range from simple
websites to complex web-based applications like email clients, social media platforms, or online shopping sites.

● User interface, HTTP/HTTPS.




## Web Services vs API:
- Web Services:
● Web services are a broad category of technologies and protocols
designed to facilitate communication and data exchange betweenb different software systems over the internet. They are meant to provide a standardized way for various applications, often on different platforms and using different programming languages, to interact with each other.

- API:
● APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), on the other hand, refer to a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They provide access to the functionality or data of an application or service for developers to use in their own applications.




### WSDL:
WSDL which stands for Web Services Description Language, is an XML-based language used to describe the functionality and interface of a web service.



## WSDL - Documents:
● A WSDL document is typically created to describe a SOAP-based web service. It defines the service's operations, their input and output message structures, and how they are bound to the SOAP protocol.

● The WSDL document effectively documents the API provided by the
service.

● The WSDL document serves as a contract between the service provider and consumers. It specifies how clients should construct SOAP requests to interact with the service. This contract defines the operations, their input parameters, and expected responses.




## WSDL - Components:
● Types: The <types> section defines the data types used in the web service. It typically includes XML Schema Definitions (XSD) that specify the structure and constraints of input and output data.

● Message: The <message> element defines the data structures used in the messages exchanged between the client and the service. Messages can have multiple parts, each with a name and a type definition referencing the types defined in the <types> section.

● Port Type: The <portType> element describes the operations that the web service supports. Each operation corresponds to a method or function that a client can invoke. It specifies the input and output messages for each operation.

● Binding: The <binding> element specifies how the service operations are bound to a particular protocol, such as SOAP over HTTP. It defines details like the protocol, message encoding, and endpoint addresses.

● Service: The <service> element provides information about the service itself. It includes the service's name and its endpoint address, which is the URL where clients can access the service.

● Operation: The operation object defined within a port type, represents a specific action that a service can perform. It specifies the name of the operation, the input message structure, the output message structure, and, optionally, fault messages that can occur during the operation.
