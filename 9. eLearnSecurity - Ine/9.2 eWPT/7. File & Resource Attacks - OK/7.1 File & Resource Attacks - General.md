###  Arbitrary File Upload


## File Upload
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability is a type of security flaw in web applications that allows an attacker to upload and execute malicious files on a web server.


## Directory/Path Traversal
Directory Traversal occurs when a web application allows unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended or authorized directory structure.
The exposure of sensitive data can lead to data breaches and the leakage of confidential information
http://example.com/download?file=user123.txt
http://example.com/download?file=../../../../../etc/passwd



## Local File Inclusion
LFI is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows an attacker to include files (external files, often scripts or templates) on the server through the web browser.
LFI vulnerabilities can exist in various parts of a web application including:

- File Inclusion Functions:
Functions like include(), require(), or file_get_contents() that accept user-controlled input for file paths.

- HTTP Parameters: 
Input fields in web forms or query parameters in URLs.

- Cookies: 
If an application uses cookies to determine the file to include.

- Session Variables:
If session data can be manipulated to control file inclusion.



## Local File Inclusion vs Directory Traversal:
LFI include the contents of a file in the server
Directory Traversal navigating file system
● LFI (Local File Inclusion): The primary objective of an LFI attack is to include and display the contents of a file on the server within the context of a web application. This could include sensitive system files, configuration files, or even user data files. 
● Directory Traversal: Directory Traversal, also known as Path Traversal, focuses on navigating the file system's directory structure to access files or directories outside the intended path. While this can lead to LFI, the primary goal is often broader, encompassing the ability to read, modify, or delete files and directories.


Remote File Inclusion - RFI:
Include the contents of a remote file in the server web.
Allow an attacker to include and execute remote files on a web server.
