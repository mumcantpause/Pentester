### WiFi Security: Traffic Analysis - Wireshark


Q1. What is the name of the Open (No Security) SSID present in the packet dump? A. SecurityTube_Open?

Filter WireShark: 
(wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0008) && (!(wlan.wfa.ie.wpa.version == 1)) && !(wlan.tag.number == 48)

[Tagged parameters]
[Tag: SSID parameter set: SecurityTube_Open]




Q2. The SSID 'Home_Network' is operating on which channel?
Filter Wireshark:
wlan contains Home_Network
[Tag: DS Parameter set: Current Channel 6]



Q3. Which security mechanism is configured for SSID 'LazyArtists'? 
Filter WireShark: wlan contains LazyArtists
[Group Cipher Suite: AES (CCM)]
[Pairwise Cipher Suite: AES (CCM)]
[Auth Key Management: PSK]


Q4. Is WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) enabled on SSID 'Amazon Wood'?
Filter Wireshark: 
(wlan.ssid contains "Amazon") && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0008)
[Tag: Vendor Specific Microsoft Corp: WPS]
[Type: WPS]




Q5. What is the total count of packets which were either transmitted or received by the device with MAC e8:de:27:16:87:18?
Filter Wireshark: (wlan.ta == e8:de:27:16:87:18) || (wlan.ra == e8:de:27:16:87:18)


Q6. What is the MAC address of the station which exchanged data packets with SSID 'SecurityTube_Open'?
Filter Wireshark: ((wlan.bssid == e8:de:27:16:87:18) ) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0020)


Q7. From the last question, we know that a station was connected to SSID 'SecurityTube_Open'. Provide TSF timestamp of the association response sent from the access point to this station. 
Filter Wireshark: (((wlan.bssid == e8:de:27:16:87:18)) && (wlan.addr==5c:51:88:31:a0:3b)) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0001)
