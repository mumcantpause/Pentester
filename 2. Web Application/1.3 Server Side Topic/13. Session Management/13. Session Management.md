### Session Management Vulnerabilities

### Session Management



## Session Management Components:
- Session Identifier: A unique token is assigned to each user's session.
- Session Data: Information related user's session (auth status, user preferences, temp data), stored on the server
- Session Cookies: Session Cookies contain the session ID. It serve various purposes such as session management, user tracking, and personalization.


## Session Management - PHP:
- Session Start:
"session_start()" function initializes the session and generates a unique session ID.

- Session Data: 
$_SESSION - store and retrieve session data
Es. $_SESSION ['username'] = 'john_doe' : stores the username in the session.

- Session Timeout: 
session.gc_maxlifetime - THe session timeout is defined in the PHP configuration file (php.ini).

- Session ID Management:
By default PHP handles the generation of session IDs and their association with users.



## Session Fixation Testing:
Setting a known session ID user's identifier (controlled by attacker) to a known value of the attacker's choice.
Es. 
"Sending the victim a link that includes the fixed session token".
"Predicting or guessing the session token".
"Intercepting session token - man in the middle".
"Manipulating the victim into clicking on a specially crafted URL".

## Session Hijacking Testing:
Capture and reuse another user's session ID with "Session Prediction", "Session Sniffing", "Cross Site Scripting".

## Session ID Brute-Force:
Bruteforce session ID
